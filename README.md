# BlockChain

Blockchain is a time-stamped decentralized series of fixed records containing data of any size controlled by a large network of computers scattered around the globe and not owned by a single organization. Every block is secured and connected with each other using hashing technology which protects it from being tampered by an unauthorized person.
